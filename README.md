# Data Analysis for USAJobs.gov

### Overview

The goal of this project is to answer the business question: How to become a Data Analyst in the U.S. government?
Therefore, this document showcases the requirements for data-related job fields with the U.S. Government. This data is collated from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the USAJobs.gov API. **The project is broken down into the following steps**

### Step 1: Extract Data

### Step 4: Clean Data

### Step 5: Visualize Data
