## Data Jobs in the U.S. Government

The goal of this document is to answer the business question: How to become a Data Analyst in the U.S. government?
Therefore, this document showcases the requirements for data-related job fields with the U.S. Government. This data is collated from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the USAJobs.gov API.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
